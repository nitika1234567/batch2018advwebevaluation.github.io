<h3 style="color:magenta" align="center"><i><u><mark>INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT MACHU PICCHU</mark></u></i></h3>
<ul>
<li>Machu Picchu is an Incan city located between the Andes Mountains of Peru and the Amazon rainforest basin.</li>
<li>The Incas built Machu Picchu in the fifteenth century AD; it was abandoned when Spaniards conquered the Inca civilization around ninety years later.</li>
<li>Machu Picchu is a site covering over 100 square miles (259 square kilometers), with around 200 religious, ceremonial, agricultural, and astronomical structures built on its lands.</li>
<li>The terraced city of Machu Picchu was planned in advance, with an upper area designated for agricultural development and lower levels intended for domestic use.</li>
<li>Some archaeologists believe that the site of Machu Picchu was selected in part for its higher altitude. Sand flies, which are common in South America and which transmit leishmaniasis, a face-deforming disease, cannot survive at the altitude of Machu Picchu.</li>
<li>The Incas that lived at Machu Picchu cultivated the coca crop, from which cocaine is derived. Many of their rituals were associated with coca agriculture.</li>
<li>In 1948, the Peruvian government built a highway leading directly to Machu Picchu, hoping to encourage tourism from other countries.</li>
<li>Although Machu Picchu is built at a higher altitude, it was just low enough for the Incan farmers to continue growing coca.</li>
<li>Machu Picchu was officially discovered by explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911, although the city had never really been “lost” to the indigenous people who lived around it.</li>
<li>Machu Picchu is located in the center of a region that was known as Cuzco to the Incas who built it.</li>
<li>The development of Machu Picchu into a major tourist site was largely the result of the “Good Neighbor” policy of US President F. D. Roosevelt, who encouraged the development of infrastructure in neighboring Latin American countries.</li>
<li>Machu Picchu was built sometime in the mid-1400s, at the height of the Incan Empire’s rule in what would become known as Latin America</li>
<li>After overseeing several expeditions to Machu Picchu from 1911 to 1914, Hiram Bingham, the explorer credited with making Machu Picchu famous, left Peru under a cloud of suspicion that he had been illegally exporting artifacts from the ancient site</li>
<li>Machu Picchu was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.</li>
<li>Probably only around 500 to 750 people at a time ever actually lived at Machu Picchu.</li>
<li>The easiest way for tourists to get to Machu Picchu is by taking a train from Lima, Peru—although some tourists prefer to hike the long Salkantay Trail to get there.</li></ul>
<h2 style="color:magenta" align="center"><i><u><mark>SOME FUN FACTS</mark></u></i></h2>
<h4 style="color:red" align="center"><i>Machu Picchu's name is extremely fitting.</i></h4>
The name Machu Picchu translates roughly to "old peak" or "old mountain" in the ancient Quechua language. ("Machu," meaning "old" and "picchu" meaning "peak.") In contrast, Huayna Picchu, the mountain in the background of everyone's Machu Picchu photos (that's it in the photo below), translates to "young mountain" or "new mountain."
<h4 style="color:red" align="center"><i>Speaking of Huayna Picchu—it's probably where you'll get the best view.</i></h4>
If you stand at the base of Machu Picchu and look up, you'll notice an even bigger mountain with yet another set of ruins. That's Huayna Picchu, the previously mentioned "young mountain"—and it's the best place to view Machu Picchu since it towers some 1,180 feet above it. Unfortunately, just 400 people are able to hike Huana Picchu a day. That's because its a treacherous climb that takes most hikers around two hours to complete. If this hair-raising climb is on your bucket list, plan to buy a ticket some three months in advance. You'll need to be 12 years or older, have an authorized guide, and you absolutely cannot be afraid of heights.
<h4 style="color:red" align="center"><i>Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu both sit at a lower elevation than the city of Cusco.</i></h4>
From that last fact, you might have thought these two peaks were some of the highest points in Peru. But it turns out, Machu Picchu is actually about 3,000 feet lower than Peru's capital city of Cusco. At 7,972 and 11,152 feet above sea level respectively, both Machu Picchu and Cusco each require a bit of high-altitude acclimation. That means if you don't take things slowly, you could be plagued by symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and nausea. And that defintiely won't make for a good vacation story.
<h4 style="color:red" align="center"><i>Historians still aren't sure exactly why Machu Picchu was built.</i></h4>
While most archeologists agree that Machu Picchu was erected as a royal estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, who ruled from 1438 to 1472, there's still room for speculation as to why he did it. One theory is that Machu Picchu was a scaled-down version of a mythic landscape from the Inca creation story, or that it was constructed to honor a sacred landscape (the site is built atop a mountain almost completely encircled by the Urubamba River, which the Inca called the Vilcamayo, or Sacred River.), writes National Geographic.
<h4 style="color:red" align="center"><i>You can get your passport stamped at the entrance.</i></h4>
If you're not from Peru, you'll have to show your passport when you arrive at the ruins, despite the fact that you already showed it to enter the country itself. Guests also have to enter their passport number to purchase their Machu Picchu entry ticket, which is required in advance. The passport you show at the gate must match the one you bought your ticket with.

And while it's not required that you get an official Machu Picchu stamp on your passport, there is an opportunity to do so. From 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., a small desk is open just past the entrance where guests can get stamped. Even though it's not required, it's certainly a great way to commemorate this once in a lifetime adventure.
