<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT CHRIST THE REDEEMER STATUE</u></i></h3>
<ul>
<li>Christ the Redeemer Statue is one of the most iconic images of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil. There are dozens of curiosities, fun and interesting facts about Christ the Redeemer Statue. Cristo Redentor (as it is called in Portuguese) is an architecture wonder, a tourist attraction, a religious symbol, a Rio de Janeiro’s landmark.</li>
<li> Was a French priest who came to live in Rio de Janeiro who had the idea of building the statue of Christ the Redeemer (the interesting and regretful fact is that it took so long for the idea to be implemented that he eventually died before the statue’s construction). ► The statue of Christ the Redeemer was built with money donated by locals.</li>
<li>It took a span of nine years to complete it. Construction started in 1922 and was completed in 1931. This statue was built in the 1931. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. This statue is one of the biggest statues in the world. The cost of the monument was $250,000. [3]</li></ul>
<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>The Statue Has Been Struck By Lightning</u></i></h3>
Christ the Redeemer is a pretty impressive structure; however, even with help from the heavens, it hasn’t been able to withstand the powers of Mother Nature. The statue has been struck by lightning more than once.

Softschools.com points out that one of the worst incidents of lightning took place in 2008 when the head, eyebrows, and fingers of the statue were damaged by an intense electrical storm. Following this, the statue was restored using soapstone from the same quarry that the original material was mined from.
<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>It Was Supposed To Look Different</u></i></h3>
The image of Christ holding his arms either in the shape of a cross or in a loving embrace is now an iconic symbol throughout the world. Interestingly, the statue was intended to look completely different from how it looks now.

The initial sketches of the statue saw Christ holding a cross in one hand and a globe in the other. This design was initially well received and was even termed “Christ with a Ball.” Eventually, the design was adapted to the Art Deco style we have today.
<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>It Will Probably Look Different In The Future
</u></i></h3>
The statue looks different from its initial design concept, but it hasn’t changed much since it was constructed. In the future, however, it’s possible that we will see some changes to the appearance of Christ the Redeemer.
The statue is coated in soapstone which gives it a light color. Now the quarry that provided the soapstone has run dry, so it may be difficult to replace the coating with material that gives the statue the same light hue. In 2020, when the next major renovation to the statue takes place, it is believed the statue will look darker.
<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>The Statue Is Full Of Hidden Messages</u></i></h3>
Christians around the world interpret Christ the Redeemer as being a symbol of love and peace. But it is thought that the statue is literally full of messages that nobody will ever read. According to BBC, volunteers would leave personal messages on the soapstone tiles used to line the outer shell of the statue.

A whopping six million soapstone tiles were used to create the exterior for the statue. The monument stands around 92 feet tall and stands on a pedestal of 26 feet, giving it even more height.
<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>It Was Restored For A Visit From The Pope</u></i></h3>
The statue was completed in 1931 and has undergone a few restorations to keep it looking pristine in the decades that have past. The first major restoration took place in 1980 in preparation for the arrival of Pope John Paul II, who was visiting Brazil that year.
<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>It Nearly Took A Decade To Complete</u></i></h3>
By the time the gigantic statue was ready to start constructing, it was 1922. It would be nearly a decade before the project was finally complete, mainly due to the sheer size of the statue. Another factor slowing down the building process was the fact that Mount Corcovado, where the landmark currently stands, was covered with thick vegetation at the time.

It may have taken nine years to complete, but the statue has proven to be longlasting. It is only two years away from being 90 years old.
<h3 style="color:voilet" align="center"><i><u>Not All Of The Statue Is Originally From Brazil</u></i></h3>
Christ the Redeemer is a symbol of Brazil. Few people visit Rio without wanting to see the famous landmark that watches over the city. But surprisingly, the statue wasn’t actually constructed in Brazil. The clay pieces were partially designed in France.

The statue was created in the European nation by French sculptor Paul Landowski, who first came up with a series of clay pieces. The clay pieces were shipped to Brazil, where Heitor da Silva Costa and his team reinforced them with concrete and completed the statue.
